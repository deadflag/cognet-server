Cognet Chat Engine  v0.1
------------------------

This application is a front-end for a irc proxy server called cognetd.
The server handles virtually all of the logic and all the client knows
about is how to display messages in windows and send user commands to
the server.  

The server caches all messages (up to 100 per channel, and unlimited
per user), even if the client is not connected.

The following commands are understood by the client:

/query <name>    creates a new window named <name> and shows it
/win <name>      switch to window <name> if it exists
/zap             log out of the server
/bind <number>   binds a quickkey (0-9) to this window
/clear           erases the contents of the current window
                 (on the server as well as the client)

Any other commands are sent to the server for processing.
The server knows a number of ircii-style commands like:
/join, /leave, /part, /msg, /nick, /topic

Anything that starts with two slashes will be passed to the
irc connection raw (eg  "//privmsg #uiuc :I like cheese!" )

Anything with no leading slash is treated as a message to the
channel/user that is the current window name.

The application menu lists all active windows (windows with 
messages that have arrived since you were there last are marked
with an arrow glyph).  There are a few handy shortcuts not shown
in the menu (for space reasons):

MENU-n          cycle to the next window
MENU-p          cycle to the previous window
MENU-,          jump to a window with new messages

Currently, server messages show up in the special "%server" window
(which you can never delete) and messages the proxy doesn't know 
how to parse show up in the special "%unknown" window.

The ugly black bar that appears below the title bar is to let you
know about messages in other windows.  Indicators like "[3]" mean
that there is a new message in a window bound to the number in 
the brackets.  A "[?]" indicator means that there are new messages
in some unbound window (check the menu for details).
